# Challenge-3_Customer-Insights-DataSteel

**Introduction**:

Just conquered a thrilling SQL challenge by SteelData, delving into the fascinating realm of Customer Insights! Utilizing the robust combo of PostgreSQL and PgAdmin4, I tackled a series of 10 insightful questions exploring the depths of customer data. Check out my solution in the GitHub repository.

**Questions**:

1. What are the names of all the countries in the country table?
2. What is the total number of customers in the customers table?
3. What is the average age of customers who can receive marketing emails (can_email is set to 'yes')?
4. How many orders were made by customers aged 30 or older?
5. What is the total revenue generated by each product category?
6. What is the average price of products in the 'food' category?
7. How many orders were made in each sales channel (sales_channel column) in the orders table?
8.What is the date of the latest order made by a customer who can receive marketing emails?
9. What is the name of the country with the highest number of orders?
10. What is the average age of customers who made orders in the 'vitamins' product category?

**Conclusion**:

The challenge demanded an intermediate level of SQL proficiency, encouraging data enthusiasts to attempt the questions independently before seeking solutions.
